Welcome to my blog! This is a place for me to collect my thoughts.
I am more likely to finish reading the books or articles that I start
if I write about them here. This may just save me from disengaging from the world 
entirely, though whether that is a good thing or not is difficult to tell. I hope you enjoy reading these posts!
